    "1. Logistics regression:\n",
    "    Logistic Regression is statistical model which is used for classification problems. It can be applied for either binary classification or multi class classification. This logistic regression is a technique to analyse which has a dependent variable and one or more independent variable. This dependent variable is in categorical in nature ( example yes/no, true/false, 0/1). It is a special case of linear regression. Logistic regression is minimized to 0 to 1 instead of -infinity to +infinity. This curve is called sigmoid curve. The threshold value decides the outcome.\n",

    "2. Decision tree classifier:\n",
    "    Decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm which looks like an inverted tree. This decision tree shows the graphical representation of  all the possible solutions. Each node represents the predictor variable. Root node will be start of the decision tree. Leaf node are the final or terminating nodes of the tree. Decision tree can be build using CART or ID3 algorithm. The main thing in decision tree algorithm is to select the best attribute. Selecting best attribute based on entropy and information gain measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Random Forest classifier:\n",
    "    Random Forest Classifier is a supervised classification and regression algorithm. This algorithm builds multiple decision tree and it glues together to get the more accurate and stable prediction. The higher number of forests in the trees, better accuracy ih the prediction result. Eventhough decision tree are convenient, they lack accuracy and it is not flexible.Random forest is based on the idea of bagging, which is used to reduce the variation in predictions by combining the result set of multiple decision trees on deifferent samples of the dataset."
